These are videos about RoboCup. A worldwide competition where teams are all given the same robots and must program them to play a soccer match. Since the sport is so popular worldwide, several scientists thought it would be a good starting point to raise public awareness about science and technology. The goal of the program is to eventually build a team of robots who can beat the World Cup winning team in an official FIFA game.
