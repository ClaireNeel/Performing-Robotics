These are videos about RoboCup. A worldwide competition where teams are all given the same robots and must program them to play a soccer match. Since the sport is so popular worldwide, several scientists thought it would be a good starting point to raise public awareness about science and technology. The goal of the program is to eventually build a team of robots who can beat the World Cup winning team in an official FIFA game. 


Our concept is a disco ball tree. There will be three buttons in the audience that depending on which is pushed will fire a beam that will bounce off the branches and hit a certain light sensor. The input from this will affect the projector, and will hopefully play out similairly to a choose your own adventure story.
We will need 3 DC motors and 9 servos. Also strong material for the branches to hold the weight. We will need to figure out how to connect the arduinos for the different branches so that they all move together.
It will probably need to be on the larger size to be able to have a strong enough base to support the branches.
